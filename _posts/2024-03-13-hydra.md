## Hydra 
Hydra is a very fast online password cracking tool, which can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 Protocols, including Telnet, RDP, SSH, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, several databases and much more. Hydra comes by default on both Parrot and Kali, however if you need it, you can find the GitHub here.
The syntax for the command we're going to use to find the passwords is this:

### How does hydra work?
```bash
hydra -t 4 -l dale -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV 10.10.10.6 ftp
hydra -t 16 -l USERNAME -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV MACHINE_IP ssh
```
Let's break it down:
